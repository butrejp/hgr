this is mostly just the kalico config for my custom 3d printer, eventually including some custom 3d printed parts I've designed for it and some miscellaneous files related to it.  it's mostly here as a backup, but someone may find it useful.

the mainboard is a BTT Octopus Pro v1.1, it uses an nf-crazy volcano uuhf hotend, CPAP fan, 2gt belts on 20t gears, 4mm pitch ball screws for Z, a euclid probe, and mechanical endstops on x and y.  it's a cartesian bed dropper, similar to an ender 5 kinematically
